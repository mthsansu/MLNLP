# File containing all code scripts for the project

- 'Descriptive_statistics.ipynb': descriptive analysis of each of our three datasets using natural language processing tools
- 'Houri_Sansu_PoliTweets_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb': building a task-specific model, training it on our manually annotated data, evaluating its performances
- 'Baseline.ipynb': building and running a baseline model to compare with our own task-specific model

The 'R_Code' folder contains additional R files which were used to work on the data. None of these files is used in the main analysis ran under Python.
